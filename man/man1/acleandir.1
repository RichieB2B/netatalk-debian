corresponding data file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\fB\-d\fR

\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-R\fR
Recursive. Clean up directories recursively.

\fB\-n\fR
Display the filenames of "orphans" but don't
remove any. Display size if "orphan" appears to contain a
resource fork.
.TP 
\fB\-i\fR
Interactive. Prompt for confirmation before a removal. A y in
answer confirms that the removal should proceed.
.TP 
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose. Display the names of all "orphans" and
\&.AppleDouble directories removed. Reports the size if the
"orphan" appears to contain a resource fork.
.TP 
\fB\-a\fR
Aggressive. Remove all AppleDouble files, not just
"orphans". Also remove the .AppleDesktop directory if
present. Impies \fB\-d\fR option. Use with caution as the
Macintosh type/creator and finder location of all files will be lost
and the content of some documents, such as Symantec Projects, will
