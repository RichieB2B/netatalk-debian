.SH NAME
pap \- client interface to remote printers using Printer Access Protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpap\fR [ \-A \fBaddress\fR ] [\-c] [\-d] [\-e] [\-E] [ \-p \fBnbpname\fR ] [ \-s \fBstatusfile\fR ] [\-w] [\-W] [\fBFILES\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
pap is used to connect and send files to an
AppleTalk connected printer using the Apple Printer Access Protocol (PAP).
When pap starts execution, it tries to open a session
with the printer using PAP, and then downloads the \fIfiles\fR
to the printer.
.PP
If no \fIfiles\fR are given on the command
line, pap begins reading from standard input.
.PP
If no printer is specified on the command line, pap
looks for a file called .paprc in the current working
directory and reads it to obtain the \fInbpname\fR
of a printer. Blank lines and lines that begin with a `\fI#\fR'
are ignored. \fItype\fR and \fIzone\fR
default to \fILaserWriter\fR and the zone of the
local host, respectively.
.PP
Note that pap is designed to be useful as a
communication filter for sending \fBlpd\fR(8)
spooled print jobs to AppleTalk connected printers. See
\fBpsf\fR(8)
for hints on how to use it this way.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\fB\-A \fR\fIaddress\fR
Connect to the printer with Appletalk address \fIaddress\fR and do not consult the
\&.paprc file to find a printer name. See
\fBatalk_aton\fR(3)
for the syntax of \fIaddress\fR.
.TP 
\fB\-c\fR
Take cuts. The PAP protocol specified a simple queuing
procedure, such that the clients tell the printer how long they have
been waiting to print. This option causes pap to
lie about how long it has been waiting.
.TP 
\fB\-d\fR
Enable debug output.
.TP 
\fB\-e\fR
Send any message from the printer to stderr instead of stdout.
\fBpsf\fR(8)
invokes pap with this option.
.TP 
\fB\-E\fR
Don't wait for EOF from the printer. This option is useful
for printers which don't implement PAP correctly. In a correct
implementation, the client side should wait for the printer to
return EOF before closing the connection. Some clients don't
wait, and hence some printers have related bugs in their
implementation.
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR \fInbpname\fR
Connect to the printer named \fInbpname\fR
and do not consult the .paprc file to find a
printer name. See \fBnbp_name\fR(3)
for the syntax of \fInbpname\fR.
.TP 
\fB\-s\fR \fIstatusfile\fR
Update the file called \fIstatusfile\fR
to contain the most recent status message from the printer.
pap gets the status from the printer when it is
waiting for the printer to process input. The \fIstatusfile\fR
will contain a single line terminated with a newline. This is useful
when pap is invoked by
\fBpsf\fR(8)
within \fIlpd\fR's spool directory.
.TP 
\fB\-w\fR
Wait for the printer status to contain the word
"waiting" before sending the job. This is to defeat
printer\-side spool available on HP IV and V printers.
.TP 
\fB\-W\fR
Wait for the printer status to contain the word "idle"
before sending the job. This is to defeat printer\-side spool
available on HP IV and V printers.
.SH FILES
.TP 
\&.paprc
file read to obtain printer name if not specified on command
line
