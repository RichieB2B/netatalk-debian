aecho [ \fB\-c\fR\fI count\fR
] ( address | nbpname )
.SH DESCRIPTION
aecho repeatedly sends an Apple Echo Protocol
(AEP) packet to the host specified by the given AppleTalk
address or nbpname and reports
whether a reply was received. Requests are sent at the rate of one per
second.
.PP
address is parsed by
\fBatalk_aton\fR(3).
nbpname is parsed by \fBnbp_name\fR(3).
The nbp type defaults to `\fIWorkstation\fR'.

When aecho is terminated, it reports the number
of packets sent, the number of responses received, and the percentage of
packets lost. If any responses were received, the minimum, average, and
maximum round trip times are reported.
