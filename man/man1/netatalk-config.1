.SH DESCRIPTION
netatalk\-config is a tool that is used to
determine the compiler and linker flags that should be used
to compile and link programs that use the \fInetatalk\fR
run\-time libraries.
.SH OPTIONS
netatalk\-config accepts the following options:
.TP 
\fB\-\-help\fR
Print a short help for this command and exit.
.TP 
\fB\-\-version\fR
Print the currently installed version of \fInetatalk\fR
on the standard output.
.TP 
\fB\-\-libs\fR
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link against the
\fInetatalk\fR run\-time libraries.
.TP 
\fB\-\-libs\-dirs\fR
Print only the \-l/\-R part of \-\-libs.
.TP 
\fB\-\-libs\-names\fR
Print only the \-l part of \-\-libs.
.TP 
\fB\-\-cflags\fR
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a
program linked against the \fInetatalk\fR
run\-time libraries.
.TP 
\fB\-\-macros\fR
Print the \fInetatalk\fR m4
directory.
.TP 
\fB\-\-prefix=PREFIX\fR
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix
that \fInetatalk\fR was built with when
computing the output for the \-\-cflags and \-\-libs options. This
option is also used for the exec prefix if \-\-exec\-prefix was not
specified. This option must be specified before any \-\-libs or
\-\-cflags options.
.TP 
\fB\-\-exec\\_prefix=PREFIX\fR
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation exec
prefix that \fInetatalk\fR was built with
