.SH "NAME"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBcnid_metad\fR
waits for requests from
\fBafpd\fR
to start up instances of the
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
daemon\&. It keeps track of the status of a
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
instance once started and will restart it if necessary\&.
\fBcnid_metad\fR
is normally started at boot time from
/etc/rc
or equivalent and runs until shutdown\&.
\fBafpd\fR
needs to be configured with the
\fB\-cnidserver\fR
option in
\fBafpd\&.conf\fR
in order to access
\fBcnid_metad\&.\fR
It is possible to run more than one instance of
\fBcnid_metad\fR
on the same machine if different values for the interface and/or port are specified with the
\fB\-h\fR
and
\fB\-p\fR
options\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-d\fR
.RS 4
\fBcnid_metad will remain in the foreground and\fR
will also leave the standard input, standard output and standard error file descriptors open\&. Useful for debugging\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR\fI hostname\fR
.RS 4
Use
\fIhostname\fR
as the network interface for requests as opposed to the default
\fBlocalhost \fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-p\fR\fI port\fR
.RS 4
Use
\fIport\fR
as the port number for reqests\&. Default is 4700\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u\fR\fI user\fR
.RS 4
Switch to the userid of
\fIuser\fR
before serving requests\&. This userid will be inherited by all
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
daemon processes started\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-u\fR\fI group\fR
.RS 4
Switch to the groupid of
\fIgroup\fR
before serving requests\&. This groupid will be inherited by all
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
daemon processes started\&. Both
\fIuser\fR
and
\fIgroup\fR
must be specified as strings\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR\fI cnid_dbd pathname\fR
.RS 4
Use
\fIcnid_dbd pathname\fR
as the pathname of the executeable of the
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
daemon\&. The default is
\fI:SBINDIR:/cnid_dbd\&.\fR
.RE
.SH "CAVEATS"
.PP
The number of
\fBcnid_dbd\fR
subprocecesses is currently limited to 512\&.
.PP
\fBcnid_metad\fR
does not block or catch any signals apart from SIGPIPE\&. It will therefore exit on most signals received\&. This will also cause all instances of
\fBcnid_dbd\'s\fR
started by that
\fBcnid_metad\fR
to exit gracefully\&. Since state about and IPC access to the subprocesses is only maintained in memory by
\fBcnid_metad\fR
this is desired behaviour\&. As soon as
\fBcnid_metad\fR
is restarted
\fBafpd\fR
processes will transparently reconnect\&.
