.TH cnid_metad 8 "28 Nov 2003" 2.0.3 Netatalk 
.SH NAME
cnid_metad \- start cnid_dbd daemons on request
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcnid_metad\fR [\-d] [ \-h \fBhostname\fR ] [ \-p \fBport\fR ] [ \-u \fBuser\fR ] [ \-g \fBgroup\fR ] [ \-s \fBcnid_dbdpathname\fR ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
cnid_metad waits for requests from \fIafpd\fR to start up instances of the \fIcnid_dbd\fR
daemon. It keeps track of the status of a \fIcnid_dbd\fR
instance once started and will restart it if necessary.
cnid_metad is normally started at boot time from
\fB/etc/rc\fR or equivalent and runs until shutdown.
\fIafpd\fR needs to be configured with the
\fB\-cnidserver\fR option in \fIafpd.conf\fR
in order to access \fIcnid_metad.\fR It is
possible to run more than one instance of cnid_metad on
the same machine if different values for the interface and/or port are
specified with the \fB\-h\fR and \fB\-p\fR options.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 
\fB\-d\fR
\fIcnid_metad will remain in the foreground
and\fR will also leave the standard input, standard output
and standard error file descriptors open. Useful for debugging.
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR\fI hostname\fR
Use \fIhostname\fR as the network
interface for requests as opposed to the default \fIlocalhost
\fR\&.
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR\fI port\fR
Use \fIport\fR as the port number for
reqests. Default is 4700.
.TP 
\fB\-u\fR\fI user\fR
Switch to the userid of \fIuser\fR
before serving requests. This userid will be inherited by all
\fIcnid_dbd\fR daemon processes started.
.TP 
\fB\-u\fR\fI group\fR
Switch to the groupid of \fIgroup\fR
before serving requests. This groupid will be inherited by all
\fIcnid_dbd\fR daemon processes started.
Both \fIuser\fR and \fIgroup\fR
must be specified as strings.
.TP 
\fB\-s\fR\fI cnid_dbd pathname\fR
Use \fIcnid_dbd pathname\fR as the
pathname of the executeable of the \fIcnid_dbd\fR
daemon. The default is \fI:SBINDIR:/cnid_dbd.\fR
.SH CAVEATS
The number of \fIcnid_dbd\fR subprocecesses
is currently limited to 128. This restriction will be lifted in the
future.
.PP
cnid_metad does not block or catch any signals
apart from SIGPIPE. It will therefore exit on most signals received. This
will also cause all instances of \fIcnid_dbd's\fR
started by that cnid_metad to exit gracefully. Since
state about and IPC access to the subprocesses is only maintained in
memory by cnid_metad this is desired behaviour. As soon
as cnid_metad is restarted \fIafpd\fR
processes will transparently reconnect.
