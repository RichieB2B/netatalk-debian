.SH NAME
papstatus \- get the status of an AppleTalk\-connected printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB:SBINDIR:/papstatus\fR [\-d] [ \-p \fBprinter\fR ] [\fBretrytime\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIpapstatus\fR is used to obtain the
current status message from an AppleTalk connected printer. It uses the
Printer Access Protocol (PAP) to obtain the status information.
.PP
If no printer is specified on the command line, \fIpapstatus\fR
looks for a file called .paprc in the current directory
and reads it to obtain the name of a printer. The .paprc
file should contain a single line of the form \fIobject\fR\fI:\fR\fI\fR\fItype\fR\fI@\fR\fI\fR\fIzone\fR
where each of \fIobject\fR, \fI:\fR\fItype\fR\fI,\fR and \fI@\fR\fIzone\fR are optional.
\fItype\fR and \fIzone\fR
must be proceeded by `\fI:\fR' and `\fI@\fR' respectively. Blank lines and lines the begin
with a `\fI#\fR' are ignored. \fItype\fR and \fIzone\fR default
to \fILaserWriter\fR and the zone of the local
host, respectively.

Normally, \fIpapstatus\fR only gets

the printer.
