netatalk (1.6.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version of Netatalk switches to Berkeley DB 4.2. During the
    development process of Debian 3.1 (sarge) earlier versions of BDB
    (3.0 and 4.0) were used. As Netatalk does not automatically update
    its database, you may experience problems like those described in
    bug #200373: no files showing up in your folders. This problem
    should not concern you if you are upgrading from Debian 3.0 (woody).

    If you have such problems, please refer to
    
      /usr/share/doc/netatalk/README.Debian
      
    for information on how to fix them.
