netatalk (2.0.4~beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Netatalk now supports encrypted authentication using new DHX2 AUM.

    Encrypted authentication is strongly recommended for all connections
    and required by recent releases of MacOS X. Until now encryption was
    possible only using randnum (which stored passwords in cleartext on
    the server) or using the older DHX UAM (which was non-distributable
    by Debian due to being considered incompatible with the GPL).

    DHX2 is now built by default but Randnum is not (it now needs
    OpenSSL).

    To use new DHX2 AUM, make sure it is included in -uamlist option of
    afpd.conf if that option is used (it is enabled by default).

    See /usr/share/doc/netatalk/README.Debian(.gz) for info on getting
    netatalk with DHX and Randnum UAMs using OpenSSL.

netatalk (1.6.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version of Netatalk switches to Berkeley DB 4.2. During the
    development process of Debian 3.1 (sarge) earlier versions of BDB
    (3.0 and 4.0) were used. As Netatalk does not automatically update
    its database, you may experience problems like those described in
    bug #200373: no files showing up in your folders. This problem
    should not concern you if you are upgrading from Debian 3.0 (woody).

    If you have such problems, please refer to
    
      /usr/share/doc/netatalk/README.Debian
      
    for information on how to fix them.
